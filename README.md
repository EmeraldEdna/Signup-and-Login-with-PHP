# Signup-and-Login-with-PHP
A Sign-up page that saves user info to database and logs in with crosschecks from the database.
This is a simple form website that takes initial user information and saves to the database using PHP and MS. Server Sql.
I used the Xampp as my server and did just a little CSS. My major focus was to be successful in recording the user information to the database 
and being able to detect wrong information when the Login does not match any of the details in the database.
